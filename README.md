## Code for the paper "Finding Conflicts of Opinion on Citizen Participation Platforms"

/!\ To run the different experiments, first the POS model and NLI models must be created (using `pos_model_creation.py` and `nli_model_creation.py`)

Experiments used in Section 5 are in the `contradiction_checking` folder.

Experiments used in Section 6 are in the `use_case` folder. Before running the experiments in `contradiction_graph.py`, the `generate_proposals_pairs.py` script must be run to generate the datasets used.
